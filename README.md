## Notice on the state of the development

After becoming a dad in 2018 the project had it place in shelves for quite a long time. In 2020 we welcomed our second baby, and it wasn't until now that I was able to start making progress again. Now I aim to finish the project and release the music video before the end of 2021.

This is my first big software project that I started years ago even before I even became a developer. Main focused had always been on the visual result than the code itself. Meanwhile C# became my main language in my career that currently I am unable to be comfortable with the code quality. Plus, it looks like that there are a few useful tools that can be extracted out of this project.

On the other side, I am not comfortable with turning extracting software tools from this project blocking the path to release the music video as an art form. At this point, it turns out that assigning two diverse purposes to the project had became harmful (Dope! Single responsibility principle everywhere huh?).

Currently I'm refactoring the code in a limited way so that people can make use of some parts of the project, while the initial goal still being to finalize the music video as fast as possible.

## Release

The project is still in progress and **not** released yet. You can watch some previews of it on this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBYE9YLbsJSD-Seaq95rhKokDs5wc5nim).

Still, the binaries for the latest state are available at the [releases section](https://github.com/guneyozsan/Guney-Ozsan-Out-There-Music-Video-Unity-3D-Demo/releases) (Windows, Mac, Linux).

Check out to development branch to see the latest state. It is mostly stable.

## Music

The music is [Out There by Guney Ozsan](https://open.spotify.com/album/59xmXDNHhe1vJWit5tIJ3r). It is a mid pace electronic music with inspirations from 70's psychedelic music and 80's science fiction.

The music consists of 2 parts, "[Part 1 - Approach](https://soundcloud.com/guneyozsan/guney-ozsan-out-there-part-1-approach?in=guneyozsan/sets/guney-ozsan-out-there)" and "[Part 2 - Probe](https://soundcloud.com/guneyozsan/guney-ozsan-out-there-part-2-probe?in=guneyozsan/sets/guney-ozsan-out-there)". Part 1 starts with a big explosive hit and sets the atmosphere in about 3 minutes. Part 2 is a groovy track that takes the listener to a psychedelic journey which lasts about 7 minutes. Part 2 is loopable and this will be used for making the music video running infinitely long with no repetition, giving an opportunity to the viewer to get lost in the experience as long as they feel comfortable.

The music was originally and non-exclusively created for the video game [Big Blue World Domination](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/game/1561/) by [Wham Games](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/author/WHAM/) ([gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0yjCBDnoA)).

## Style

The challenge of this project is to let the viewer dive into an impressive psychedelic experience within the world suggested by the music, while at the same time carrying and representing the characteristics of a demo as in the demoscene sense. So both the general aesthetic and technical approaches should be consistent with the classic demo style but in a non-conservative sense. This can be implemented in various ways such as runtime procedural generation, minimalism in code, wow moments, playing with geometry and colors, and generating an atmosphere or perhaps a world. 

## Concept

![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/W49RTpy.gif?1 "Screenshot")

The music piece that cultivates the visuals is quite psychedelic, carrying characteristics from 70's psychedelic rock and impressions from 80's science fiction (both literature and cinema) which are implemented in a subtle modern electronic music style.

Out There consists of two parts where Part I is called "Approach" and Part II is called "Probe". Part I (Approach) is taken as an approach to an immersive unknown, and Part II (Probe) feels like experiencing that unknown while being immersed in it.

To establish a basis of concept for visuals, science fiction approach is preffered and the concept is more like discovering a new planet or star system but in a psychedelic mood or state of mind.

## History

The basic implementation of the idea for this was written in 2014 but it couldn't continue due to various reasons like immature ideas to progress and life itself. Now feeling more capable and comfortable, the project is revived. 

## Progress

- ~~Translate original Javascript codebase to C#.~~
- ~~Refactor the prototype code with a better architecture.~~
- ~~Improve the system for forming letters with planetesimals.~~
- ~~Part I composition~~
- Part II composition **(in progress)**
- Explore visual effect possibilities through color, shader, post-processing.
- Experiment with various user interactions.
- Take screen recording as music video.
- Introduce a main menu for different modes.
- Publish the music video on web and self-publish the runtime version.
- Look for publishing opportunities for the runtime version such as Steam, mobile...etc.
- Make a VR version.
- Publish VR version.
