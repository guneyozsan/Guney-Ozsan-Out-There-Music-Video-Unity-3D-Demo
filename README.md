## Release
The project is still in progress and not released yet. But the binaries for the latest state are available at the [releases section](https://github.com/guneyozsan/Guney-Ozsan-Out-There-Music-Video-Unity-3D-Demo/releases) (Windows, Mac, Linux).

Please check the latest feature or development branch using Unity 3D for catching up with the latest state. Development is mostly linear and almost all commits are stable and runnable.

## Music
The music piece is Out There by [Guney Ozsan](http://www.guneyozsan). It is a mid pace electronic music with inspirations from 70's psychedelic music and 80's science fiction.

* [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/guneyozsan/sets/guney-ozsan-out-there)

The music consists of 2 parts, "[Part 1 - Approach](https://soundcloud.com/guneyozsan/guney-ozsan-out-there-part-1-approach?in=guneyozsan/sets/guney-ozsan-out-there)" and "[Part 2 - Probe](https://soundcloud.com/guneyozsan/guney-ozsan-out-there-part-2-probe?in=guneyozsan/sets/guney-ozsan-out-there)". Part 1 starts with a big explosive hit and sets the atmosphere in about 3 minutes. Part 2 is a groovy track that takes the listener to a psychedelic journey which lasts about 7 minutes. Part 2 is loopable and this will be used for making the music video running infinitely long with no repetition, giving an opportunity to the viewer to get lost in the experience as long as they feel comfortable.

The music was originally and non-exclusively created for the video game [Big Blue World Domination](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/game/1561/) by [Wham Games](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/site/games/author/WHAM/) ([gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI0yjCBDnoA)).

## Style
The challenge of this project is to let the viewer dive into an impressive psychedelic experience within the world suggested by the music, while at the same time carrying and representing the characteristics of a demo as in the demoscene sense. So both the general aesthetic and technical approaches should be consistent with the classic demo style but in a non-conservative sense. This can be implemented in various ways such as runtime procedural generation, minimalism in code, wow moments, playing with geometry and colors, and generating an atmosphere or perhaps a world. 

## Concept
The music piece that cultivates the visuals is quite psychedelic, carrying characteristics from 70's psychedelic rock and impressions from 80's science fiction (both literature and cinema) which are implemented in a subtle modern electronic music style.

Out There consists of two parts where Part I is called "Approach" and Part II is called "Probe". Part I (Approach) is taken as an approach to an immersive unknown, and Part II (Probe) feels like experiencing that unknown while being immersed in it.

To establish a basis of concept for visuals, science fiction approach is preffered and the concept is more like discovering a new planet or star system but in a psychedelic mood or state of mind.

## History
The basic implementation of the idea for this was written in 2014 but it couldn't continue due to various reasons like immature ideas to progress and life itself. Now feeling more capable and comfortable, the project is revived. 

## Progress
- ~~Translate original Javascript codebase to C#.~~
- ~~Refactor the prototype code with a better architecture.~~
- ~~Improve the system for forming letters with planetesimals.~~
- ~~Part I composition~~
- Part II composition. **(in progress)**
- Place the first person view on the cubes in Part 2.
- Explore visual effect possibilities through color, shader, post-processing.
- Research and experiment  various user interaction possibilities.
- Take screen recording.
- Publish the music video on web and self-publish the runtime version.
- Look for publishing opportunities for the runtime version such as Steam, mobile...etc.
- Work on a VR version.
- Publish VR version.
