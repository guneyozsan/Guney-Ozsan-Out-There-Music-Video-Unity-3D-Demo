Open source real time music video in demoscene style made with Unity 3D for Out There by Guney Ozsan.

The vision or in other words the challenge of the project is to let the viewer dive into an impressive psychedelic experience within the world suggested by the music, while at the same time carrying and representing the characteristics of a demo as in the demoscene sense. So both the general aesthetic and technical approaches should be consistent with the classic demo style in a non-conservaitve sense. These approaches can be implemented in various ways such as runtime procedural generation, minimalism in code, wow moments, playing with geometry and colors, and generating an atmosphere or perhaps a world. 

The music piece that cultivates the visuals is quite psychedelic, carrying characteristics from 70's psychedelic rock and impressions from 80's science fiction (both literature and cinema) which are implemented in a subtle modern electronic music style. The music consists of two parts where Part I is called "Approach" and Part II is called "Probe". Part I (Approach) is taken as an approach to an immersive unknown, and Part II (Probe) feels like experiencing that unknown while being immersed in it. To establish a basis of concept for visuals, science fiction approach is preffered and the concept is more like discovering a new planet or star system but in a psychedelic mood or state of mind.

The basic implementation of the idea for this was writtine in 2014 but it couldn't continue due to various reasons like immature ideas to progress and life itself. Now feeling more comfortable, the project is revived.

General steps:
- Translate original Javascript codebase to C# (in progress).
- Refactor the code with a better architecture.
- Place the first person view on the cubes in Part 2.
- Write the names of Part 1 and Part 2 of the music piece with cubes.
- Research and experiment  various user interaction possibilities.
- Take screen recording.
- Publish the music video on web and self-publish the runtime version.
- Look for publishing opportunities for the runtime version such as Steam, mobile...etc.
- Work on a VR version.
- Publish VR version.
